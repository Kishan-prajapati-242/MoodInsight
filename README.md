# MoodInsight
This repository contains the source code for a dummy web application built with React.js. The purpose of this application is to simulate a depression detection tool that analyzes Twitter User IDs for signs of depression and provides recommendations for improving mental well-being. 

## Features

- Twitter UID-based Detection: Users can input a Twitter User ID, and the application simulates the analysis of their recent tweets for potential signs of depression.

- Dummy Recommendations: Upon analysis, the application provides simulated recommendations for improving mental health scores. These recommendations are placeholders and do not reflect actual OpenAI outputs.

- MADRS Score: For users who do not have Twitter or prefer an alternative assessment, the application simulates a self-assessment using the Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). 

- User Authentication: Although the backend functionalities are not implemented, the application includes simulated user authentication for sign-up and login purposes.

- Single Page Application (SPA) Architecture: Built as a single page application, the user experiences seamless navigation and responsiveness.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: React.js, Tailwind
